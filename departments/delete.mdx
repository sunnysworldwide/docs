## Notes

- This is an admin-only endpoint - requires administrative privileges
- Department ID must be a valid MongoDB ObjectId
- **Deletion is permanent** - cannot be undone
- Department must be empty (no assigned users) to be deleted
- All sub-departments must be deleted first
- The response includes the deleted department's details
- `deletedAt` timestamp is added to track when deletion occurred

## Prerequisites for Deletion

Before deleting a department, ensure:

1. **No Active Users**: All users must be reassigned to other departments
2. **No Sub-departments**: All child departments must be deleted first
3. **No Dependencies**: No active workflows depend on this department

## Deletion Workflow

1. **Check Users**: Verify no users are assigned to the department
2. **Handle Sub-departments**: Delete or move all child departments
3. **Reassign Users**: Move any remaining users to other departments
4. **Delete Department**: Call this endpoint to remove the department

## Error Scenarios

### Department has users
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "DEPARTMENT_HAS_USERS",
    "message": "Cannot delete department with assigned users"
  }
}
```

### Department has sub-departments
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "DEPARTMENT_HAS_CHILDREN",
    "message": "Cannot delete department with sub-departments"
  }
}
```

## Impact Analysis

### Before Deletion
- Check user assignments
- Verify sub-department status
- Review dependent systems

### After Deletion
- Department is permanently removed
- Historical data may reference deleted department
- Users cannot be assigned to deleted department

## Best Practices

1. **Backup Data**: Export department data before deletion
2. **User Communication**: Notify affected users of changes
3. **Gradual Process**: Use deprecation before deletion when possible
4. **Audit Trail**: Document deletion reasons and approvals
5. **Testing**: Test deletion process in non-production environment

## Safety Considerations

- **Irreversible Action**: Confirm before proceeding
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure no broken references
- **User Impact**: Minimize disruption to users
- **Compliance**: Follow organizational deletion policies

## Alternative Approaches

Instead of deletion, consider:
- **Archiving**: Mark department as inactive
- **Renaming**: Repurpose for new use
- **Merging**: Combine with another department
