## Notes

- This is an admin-only endpoint - requires administrative privileges
- Department names must be unique across the entire organization
- Parent department ID must be a valid MongoDB ObjectId
- Creating a sub-department requires the parent to exist
- The created department is returned in the response
- Timestamps are automatically generated (createdAt, updatedAt)
- Department names are case-sensitive
- Consider the organizational structure before creating departments

## Best Practices

1. **Planning**: Map out your department hierarchy before creation
2. **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names
3. **Descriptions**: Provide meaningful descriptions for clarity
4. **Hierarchy**: Keep hierarchy levels reasonable (recommended: max 5 levels)
5. **Review**: Review department structure periodically

## Common Use Cases

- Creating new functional departments (e.g., "Data Science")
- Adding regional offices as departments
- Setting up project-based departments
- Restructuring organizational units
