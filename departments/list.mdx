## Notes

- This is an admin-only endpoint - requires administrative privileges
- Pagination is zero-based (start at 0)
- Setting both start and end to 0 returns all departments
- The response includes a total count for pagination controls
- Departments are returned as a flat list without hierarchy
- Use the `/department/hierarchy` endpoint for hierarchical view
- Departments are sorted by creation date (newest first)
- The list includes both parent and child departments
