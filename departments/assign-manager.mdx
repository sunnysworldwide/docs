## Notes

- This is an admin-only endpoint - requires administrative privileges
- Department ID must be a valid MongoDB ObjectId
- User ID must be a valid MongoDB ObjectId
- The assigned user automatically gets "manager" role in the department
- Previous manager (if any) is demoted to regular member
- The user must already be a member of the department
- If user is not in department, they are added first as manager

## Manager Privileges

Department managers typically have:
- Full department access and control
- Ability to manage department members
- Access to department analytics and reports
- Approval authority for department requests
- Representation in organizational meetings

## Use Cases

- **Promotion**: Promote a team member to management
- **Replacement**: Replace departing or transferred manager
- **Reorganization**: Assign new leadership during restructuring
- **Interim Management**: Assign temporary manager

## Best Practices

1. **Verify Eligibility**: Ensure user is suitable for management role
2. **Communicate Changes**: Notify team about leadership changes
3. **Training**: Provide management training if needed
4. **Access Review**: Review manager permissions after assignment
5. **Documentation**: Document the reason for management change

## Error Handling

- **User Not Found**: User ID doesn't exist in system
- **Department Not Found**: Department ID doesn't exist
- **Invalid Permissions**: User lacks required permissions
- **Already Manager**: User is already the department manager

## Impact on Users

### New Manager
- Gains elevated permissions within department
- Can view and manage department resources
- Receives management notifications and reports
- May see additional dashboard features

### Previous Manager
- Loses manager privileges but remains in department
- Retains regular department member access
- May need to hand over responsibilities

### Department Members
- See new manager in organizational charts
- May receive notifications about leadership change
- Continue with normal department operations

## Security Considerations

- Manager role grants significant permissions
- Regularly review manager assignments
- Consider audit trails for management changes
- Ensure proper authorization for this endpoint
