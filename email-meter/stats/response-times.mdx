## SLA Compliance

### Current SLA: 15 Minutes
- **Within SLA**: Response sent within 15 minutes
- **Outside SLA**: Response sent after 15 minutes
- **First Response**: Time to first reply in conversation
- **Overall Response**: Time to final resolution

### SLA Calculations
```
SLA Compliance Rate = (withinSLA / (withinSLA + outsideSLA)) * 100
```

## Use Cases

- **Service Quality**: Monitor email response performance
- **SLA Reporting**: Track compliance with service level agreements
- **Team Performance**: Evaluate agent response times
- **Process Improvement**: Identify areas needing faster responses
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Correlate response times with satisfaction

## Performance Metrics

### Response Time Categories
- **Excellent**: < 5 minutes
- **Good**: 5-15 minutes (within SLA)
- **Needs Improvement**: 15-60 minutes
- **Poor**: > 60 minutes

### Benchmarking
- Compare against industry standards
- Track improvement over time
- Identify peak performance periods
- Monitor team performance trends

## Best Practices

1. **Monitoring**: Regularly check SLA compliance
2. **Alerts**: Set up alerts for SLA breaches
3. **Analysis**: Analyze patterns in delayed responses
4. **Training**: Use data for agent training
5. **Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks in response process
