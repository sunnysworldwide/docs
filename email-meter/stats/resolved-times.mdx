| max     | number  | Maximum time from first email to resolution (minutes) |
| average | number  | Average time from first email to resolution (minutes) |
| median  | number  | Median time from first email to resolution (minutes) |

#### Resolution Time Metrics
| Field   | Type    | Description                              |
|---------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| min     | number  | Minimum resolution time (minutes)        |
| max     | number  | Maximum resolution time (minutes)        |

## Resolution Categories

### Time Categories
- **Excellent**: < 30 minutes
- **Good**: 30-60 minutes
- **Acceptable**: 60-120 minutes
- **Needs Improvement**: 120-240 minutes
- **Critical**: > 240 minutes

### Delay Impact
```javascript
const delayImpact = {
  withDelays: data.data.fromLastAssignedAgent.withDelays.average,
  withoutDelays: data.data.fromLastAssignedAgent.withoutDelays.average,
  impactPercentage: ((withDelays - withoutDelays) / withoutDelays) * 100
};
```

## Use Cases

- **Service Quality**: Monitor conversation resolution efficiency
- **Process Improvement**: Identify bottlenecks in resolution
- **Customer Experience**: Track time to issue resolution
- **Team Performance**: Evaluate agent resolution capabilities
- **SLA Management**: Track resolution service level agreements

## Performance Metrics

### Resolution Efficiency
```javascript
const efficiencyMetrics = {
  sameDayResolution: percentage < 1440, // Less than 24 hours
  quickResolution: percentage < 60,      // Less than 1 hour
  standardResolution: percentage < 480,  // Less than 8 hours
  extendedResolution: percentage >= 480  // More than 8 hours
};
```

### Delay Analysis
- **Processing Delays**: Time spent in queues and routing
- **Agent Delays**: Time waiting for agent availability
- **Customer Delays**: Time waiting for customer responses
- **System Delays**: Technical processing delays

## Best Practices

1. **Monitoring**: Track resolution times continuously
2. **Alerts**: Set up alerts for extended resolutions
3. **Analysis**: Analyze patterns in delayed resolutions
4. **Optimization**: Streamline resolution processes
5. **Training**: Focus on resolution time improvement

- Use `/email-meter/stats/response-times` for initial response metrics
- Use `/email-meter/stats/agents-detailed` for agent-specific resolution data
- Use `/email-meter/stats/flags` for flagged conversation metrics

## Notes

- Resolution times are calculated in minutes
- Times are based on business hours by default
- Only resolved conversations are included in calculations
- Delays include queue time, routing delays, and customer response waits
- Automated resolutions are excluded from manual resolution metrics
